            Hopefully, I can accomplish this assignment. I have really struggled with some of these assignments. 
            The V School <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/bootcampprimer">videos</a> are very helpful,
            and I do enjoy watching them and have learned a lot from them. The videos are very well made, and the instructors are great. I have bookmarked
            these videos so I can refer back to them in the future.

            <p><ul>
                <li><b>Static position</b>
                    This is the default CSS position applicable to all HTML elements. This position place the HTML elements based on normal document flow. Using this position, top/right/bottom/left properties can not be applicable to elements (ie., static position elements donâ€™t obey top/right/bottom/left properties).
                    <div>Note: Page scrolling does affect this position.</div></li>
                <li><b>Relative position</b>
                    This position places the element relative to its normal position. This position is relative to normal document flow. Here top/right/bottom/left properties can be applied to elements.
                    <div>Note:Page scrolling does affect this position.
                        If position only applied without top/right/bottom/left properties, it will act like Static position.</div></li>
                <li><b>Absolute position</b>
                    This position places the element at the exact position specified.
                    <div>Note:
                        Page scrolling does affect this position.
                        This position element is completely removed from normal document flow.</div></li>
                <li><b>Fixed position</b>
                    This position places the element at a fixed place relative to the viewport. Page scrolling does not affect this position.
                    <div>Note: This position element is completely removed from normal document flow.</div></li>

                <h2>Margins, Border, & Padding</h2>
                <h3>November 7, 2021</h3>
                <div>
                    <img class="mbp"

                <p>Margins, borders, and padding are important when formatting. The V school video explains this, but I found the picture most helpful in
                    understanding how each one works. Basically, working from the inside out when it comes to each html element. 
                    <ul><b>CSS Properties:</b>
                        <li><u>Border:</u></li>
                         <div>Example: border: 3px solid black</div>
                         <span class="borders">Borders need to specify: width, style, color</span>
                        <li><u>Padding:</u></li>
                        <div>Example: padding: 15px</div>
                         <span class="pad">Padding is inside the border</span>
                        <li><u>Margin:</u></li>
                        <div>Example: margin:15px</div>
                        <span class="margin">Margins are outside of border</span>
                        <div><span class="all">With all of these properties, you can specify: top, bottom, left, right</span></div>
                </p></span>
        </div>

        <div>

                <h2>Live Server</h2>

                <p>Live Server is an extension is VS Code, I really like this feature because you can see your changes in real time, which is very helpful.
                    To easly open Live Server in VS code hit: <b>Shift + Ctrl + P</b>, this will open your server window. It will update when you save changes within your 
                    .html & .css files. Simply hit: <b>Ctrl + S</b> to quickly save and changes.

            <p>Learning the basics of HTML and CSS is important. <ul>
                <li>#1: Don't forget to link your HTML to your style sheet</li>
                <li>#2: Don't forget to close your code, it is amazing how forgetting a > can mess up an entire section in HTML</li>
                <li>#3: Also don't forget the importance of a semi-colon; after CSS styling</li>
